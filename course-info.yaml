language: English
summary: "<p>Have you ever used any task management systems like Jira or Trello? This\
  \ project is the perfect starting point to build a small yet feature rich application\
  \ on your own. In this project, you will develop a task management system that allows\
  \ users to create, update, and manage tasks. You'll implement JWT authentication\
  \ to protect your system and create aggregate views of tasks. This will give you\
  \ a good practice in creating advance CRUD applications and provide you with the\
  \ necessary skills to create a useful web service for your portfolio and daily use.</p>"
